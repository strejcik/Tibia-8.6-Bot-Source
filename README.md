### Usage

`Run Tibia 8.6`

`Run Tibia-Bot.exe`

### Information

- "Tibia-Bot.exe" and "Tibia-Bot.dll" are 100% clean and free of viruses. Anti-virus might claim that those files are malicious/dangerous it's because there is reading/writing in Tibia memory. It's false positive. Also if you have your anti virus running it might block "Tibia-Bot.exe" or "Tibia-Bot.dll", so you can add those 2 files for exceptions in anti-virus settings.

- Bot probably is not compatibile with older version of Windows. Works fine with Windows 10
